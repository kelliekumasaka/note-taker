# Note Taker<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
## Description
Upon deployment, this app will take you to the main page that asks you to get started. After clicking the button, the user is sent to another HTML, which asks for a note title, as well as content. Then the user should click the save button and the note will show up in the sidebar queue. If user decides that they want to delete a note, they simply click on the trash bin to the corresponding note and it will be removed. 

When you open the app, this is the landing page:
